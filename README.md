*Dye leather horse armor only where it is meant to be dyed!*

### Something isn't quite right!
Has suiting up your prized horse in leather horse armor ever caught your eye as queer? Something is dreadfully off with leather horse armor in Minecraft. Unlike the player armor, the colored details of leather horse armor get dyed! Dyed fixes this mistake so your horses can wear their leather armor with pride!

### What is wrong?
Originally an exclusive feature of Pocket Edition, when ported to Java Edition the leather horse armor textures were flattened into a single texture, causing both the colored details and monochrome base texture to be dyed. As well, any code that would have allowed for a separate overlay was lost, meaning this was not as simple to fix as adding a texture. You may think that because this already existed with the leather armor for the player, how could it have possibly gone awry for the leather horse armor? Such remains a mystery!

### Give your horses some love!
Dyed cleaves the leather horse armor texture in two once again and fixes the model code to dye only the base texture! The item model for the leather horse armor is also replaced to fix the dyeing for the item as well!

Please note that this bug has finally been fixed in Minecraft 1.21.11, so while Dyed will still work, it is now unnecessary! It will no longer be marked as compatible starting with 1.21.11.
