# <p align="center">DYED</p>

Dyed is a Fabric mod that fixes the dyeing of leather horse armor! Have you ever noticed that something was not quite right about horses in Minecraft? No, not that they do not drop that delicious horse meat, but rather that their leather horse armor gets fully dyed, even the colored parts! Unlike the player armor, which has an overlay texture that is not tinted, the horse armor has no provision for such an overlay layer. Despite the texture appearing half designed to be properly dyeable (it looks like a dyeable layer and overlay layer were just flattened into one image), the horse armor just wasn't coded to have it be so. Now you can have leather horse armor with that overlay!

### Source Building

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Fabric-1.18 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/dyed.git

cd ./dyed

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
